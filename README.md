# Power Code Validator README

Power Code Validator is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps enforce naming and validation standards in **Canvas Apps**. It automatically checks your app for consistency, ensuring controls, variables, and prefixes follow project-specific rules.

## Key Features
- üîç Validates control prefixes against configurable project standards
- üõ† Ensures all variables are properly declared
- ‚ö° Provides quick feedback directly inside VS Code
- üìÇ Customizable configuration for project-specific naming rules
- üöÄ Helps maintain consistency and best practices across large Canvas Apps
- üìä Reduces manual code review effort by automating validations 


## Code Validation in Action

The Power Code Validator makes it easy to identify naming and coding standard issues in your Canvas Apps.  From the main screen, you can quickly review all controls, variables, and prefixes against the configured project standards.

The **Control Name Standards** screen allows you to configure and verify the naming prefixes used for each control type in your Canvas Apps.  By maintaining consistent prefixes, your project remains clean, standardized, and easier to maintain.
